# Hypixel Skyblock autobrewer
Download schematics for my Hypixel Skyblock autobrewer(s)

## Main 35-potion bingo splashes brewer
### General features
- automatic input of awkward potions, xp boosts, spirit/mf etc.
- seperate brewer to automatically fill awkward potion storages
- brew up to 192 splashes in one batch without refilling the potion ingredients
- brews (coffee etc.) have to be put in manually due to Hypixel's mechanics (this is unavoidable with any system)

<ins>**!! Important !!**</ins> The brewer will break if you don't open every brewing stand every time before starting to brew a batch of splashes! If you reload your island, this gets reset. This is another issue caused by Hypixel and is unavoidable. Tip: Do this at the same time as you're initially filling the ingredients into the brewing stands


### XL storage variant
- 6 double chests of output storage (373 full splashes in total)
- 'rainbow' and 'lazy' variants available
### Large storage variant
- 4 double chests of output storage (255 full splashes in total)
- 'rainbow' and 'lazy' variants available
### Medium storage variant (recommended for most people)
- 3 double chests of output storage (196 full splashes in total)
- 'rainbow' and 'lazy' variants available
### Small storage variant
- 2 double chests of output storage (137 full splashes in total)
- only 'lazy' variant available ('rainbow' variant not available due to space restrictions of the small size storage unit)

*More variants (especially ones with reduced potion counts) and different 'upgrade' modules in progress*

Note: Only use 'lazy' variants if you're *really* lazy and don't care about the potions not being in consistent rainbow order. You don't gain any functionality by building the 'lazy' variant, as you can use the full variant in 'lazy' mode as well.

## Alchemy 50 autobrewer (fully automatic)
### Variants
- Enchanted Fermented Spider Eye
- Enchanted Sugar Cane
### Features
- fully automatic: leave running afk and claim the xp by emptying the storage through a brewing stand
- optional glowstone functionality for some money back by npc selling
- easy to build and easily extendable (1 block wide columns)

<ins>Warning!</ins> Make sure you open every brewing stand before starting the autobrewer! Also obviously don't leave your island while the brewer is running
